# *Beverlay - A Hypixel bedwars overlay.*

## NEXT UPDATE:
#### I am planning on releasing 2.0 version of Beverlay, it will no longer be in the terminal but it will be a gui application.
### Coming features:
* Getting the bedwars stats of a single player by passing it as an argument
* Support for linux and mac os.
* Support for clients such as, feather client, blc and vanilla.

## Regarding the current version
#### This version is heavily under developed because I had forgotten about this project. If you prefer this version, or more specifically, the terminal aspect of it, it will still be up for downloading under the '1.0' folder.
